% If you set this parameter to false, the simulator generates measurements
% with no noise in them. You might find this useful for debugging.
% However, unless specified otherwise, any submitted results must have this
% value set to true.

% This tells the SLAM system to do a very detailed check that the input
% appears to be correct but can make the code run slowly. Once you are
% confident your code is working safely, you can set this to false.
