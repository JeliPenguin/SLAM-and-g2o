# COMP0130: Graph-based Optimisation and SLAM Coursework

## Overview

This repository contains the coursework submissions for the COMP0130 module at University College London, focusing on Graph-based Optimisation and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. The coursework is structured around implementing and testing a SLAM system using a graphical model approach with different sensor integrations in MATLAB using the g2o library.


## Repository Structure

- `COMP0130_-_23-24_CW_02.pdf`: Coursework Instruction PDF
- `COMP0130_CW2_GROUP_10.pdf`: Coursework report
- `/Code`: MATLAB implementation for the questions

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure MATLAB (version recommended by course guidelines) is installed on your system.

## Usage

Each main task of the coursework is divided into different scripts, which can be executed independently:

- **Q1 Scripts**: Focus on vehicle motion prediction and sensor integration (odometry, compass, GPS).
- **Q2 Scripts**: Extend the system to perform SLAM and explore graph properties.
- **Q3 Scripts**: Discuss and implement performance improvements.

Run each script within MATLAB to perform the tasks described in the coursework document.
